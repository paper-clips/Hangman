# Hangman
The old school word game, created using Python.

## Getting started
To set the secret word or phrase, change the ```secretPhrase``` variable, and make sure to update the ```hint``` variable as well so your friend can get a hint about the phrase/word.

To run the game: ```hangman.py```

## Console output example
